ASSIGNMENT 5: OSAMA AHMAD - Changes made are laid out below

1. Added a fan in the maze that spins. The fan represents the fans found within computers
that help cool the Computer down. The fan has collision and is an obstacle for players as they
must wait for a gap in the blades to make it past.

2. Added a satellite spinning in the top right corner of the maze. Because the maze represents
a computer, the satellite represents the internet capabilities of the computer as the satellite
gets wifi.

3. I added a billboard to the bottom of the maze that shows the instructions for the game. 
Because you cannot turn the camera left or right and it only follows the player,
the billboard is always facing the right direction. I also added a binary texture to the 
billboard.

4. I added a light over a motherboard in the right corner of the game. The light is colored
green to match the color of the mother board.

5. I added a light over a fan near the center of the game. The light is colored
white to match the color of the 

6. I added a little "win tune" that plays for the player who successfully finishes the maze
first.

7. I added the ability for the player to play some music for the game to sound a little bit
more lively. The player simply presses M and some techno music (fitting the theme of the game)
plays on loop. This is specified in the instructions.
